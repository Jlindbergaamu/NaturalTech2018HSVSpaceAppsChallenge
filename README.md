# NaturalTech2018HSVSpaceAppsChallenge
This program has two components. One component is the source code for the database of a sample of Alabama plant-life, and the other component is solely the Swift program that can be compiled and ran through Xcode.
The objective of our application is to provide a mobile tool that will take a picture of a plant, identify it, and provide details about the plant. This data will be verified by an enviromentalist and this data will be reported directly to NASA.
